# Multiplication Table using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

This Python project demonstrates the generation of multiplication tables using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts. By following this code, you can create and display multiplication tables for any number using classes and objects in Python.

## Features

- Generate multiplication tables for any number.
- Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles for a clean and organized code structure.
- Easy to understand and modify for learning and educational purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiplication-table-using-OOPs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd multiplication-table-using-OOPs
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python multiplication_table.py
   ```

4. Enter the number for which you want to generate the multiplication table.

5. The program will display the multiplication table for the entered number.

## Example

If you run the program and enter `5`, the output will be:

```
Multiplication Table for 5:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```
